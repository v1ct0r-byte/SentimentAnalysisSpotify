rock with the promethazineinspired trap rocky's become famous for the majority of the album was recorded in london where rocky discovered a protégé and a friend in joe fox who appears on standouts max

to set baroquepop standards with their album how big how blue how beautiful its simple conceptlead singer florence welch attempts to break off a relationshipsoars thanks to a heap of melodrama and a pinch of restraint  welch lets her emotions shine through her vocals whether she's growling on the ragefilled what kind of man or sighing resignedly on the atmospheric long  lost by limiting how many times she references water welch stretches her lyricism to encompass even more imagery the transcendent results include delilah which elevates a missed phone call to biblical proportions i'm calling for my mother as i pull the pillars down it's a different kind of danger and my feet are spinning around  never knew i was a dancer 'til delilah showed me how  producer markus dravs redirects ftm's

collaborator dj esco's release from a dubai prison alternately somber and jubilant the album paints a picture of a drugged out but resilient creative drowning his pain in codeine to inspire the trappers he left behind  following on the heels of 04's breakup record monster and the innovative zaytoven collab beast mode futurehive were in full swarm for fresh heat rocksthey were satiated by tracks like trap niggas and march madness which retain a social conscience in the midst of debauchery and felony march madness one of 05's liveliest bangers comes with a triumphant beat from tarentino it's the only track on the tape not produced by southsideit's both an ode to lean and an elegy all these cops killing niggas tragic somehow doesn't sound out of place on what became a club and radio standard the anthemic trap niggas is much more than a series of coke rap tropes on a dark brooding beat future's shifting between first and third person invites the listener to identify with him and universalizes the dealer's struggle he offers a message of hope rooted in a profound belief that whatever one's station in life and the thankless tasks one performs god blessing all the trap niggas shaz           7 clarence clarity  no nowif youre thinking clarence clarity sounds like an internet meme youre not entirely wrong no now is the debut album by multiist singer and embodiment of the internet age the maximalist atmosphere of no now entertains even those with the shortest attention spans as sounds from seemingly countless genres clash glitch and mold into one to create the most serene aura  clarences musical style likely derives from his drive to be different something made abundantly clear on the second track will to believe as he breaks through a dense wall of sound to denounce the nonrisk takers and those who attempt to appear cute in the modern era where songs rarely stick to one pure genre artists are boxed in by a myriad of sounddefining labels clarence clarity has managed to create his own box no now is hectic its unpredictable its everchanging from the poppy melodies of those who cant cheat to the gritty  work of porn mountain to the completely glitchedout mess of hit factory of sadness clarence clarity creates a unique journey in a way no now represents the world we live in nothing is guaranteed in the futureall we have is now we can choose to sit back and let the unitake its path or we can evolve and become one with the erratic atmosphere take a step into clarence claritys beautifully insane world with no now youll find the unknown to be quite exhilarating  matt witkowsky           6 wolf alice  my love is coolkeep your beady eyes on me warns yearold ellie roswell over shimmering synths and intricate  arpeggios and it would be hard to resist the albums opener turn to dust is a seductive enigmatic number which sets the tone of the london fourpieces debut cool accomplished and never failing to surprise the listener no two tracks sound the same indeed in the middle of the album were transported on a whistlestop tour from the smooth and considered silk to the jazzy slap bass of freazy and then to the energetic single giant peach which sounds like it couldve been written in the mid90s producer mike crosseys versatility is commendable his sound knowledge of dynamics is especially prominent on songs like fluffy tracks are spacious and reflective when necessary and the incredible diversity of styles makes it all the more impressive that one man has achieved such a feat all four members of the band lend their vocal talents to the project with joel taking full creative reign and lead vocals on the reverbdrenched swallowtail i never thought wed hit this hard he sings in the verses before breaking into an assured falsetto for the  a cynic could call this sort of variation inconsistent but the eclectic styles allow the band members individual skills to flourish if you appreciate unique lyricism innovative structure and great replay value don't sleep on my love is cool  luke ballance unbalanced           5 miguel  wildheartmiguel begins his third lp with the words dont ever sell your self short for acceptance its a drastic change from what weve come to expect on the opening of a miguel album it follows a heartfelt instagram post in which he detailed the spark behind wildheart as well as the personal and emotional sentiment he takes inspiration from his home town of la with every song having a connection to the city of angels this concept allows miguel to expand his horizons and showcase the improvement in his writing skills with themes of power fame childhood insecurities and at his most daring alluding to las adult film industry on the valley the infusion of electric s layered over heavy bass lines and synths results in a psychedelic rockrb sound reminiscent of princes sign o the times the atmospheric vibe beautifully meshes over his more passionate songs with flesh and the deluxe edition cut gfg showcasing his breathtaking falsetto over a pulsating bass backed by an electric  riff the lead single coffee seamlessly acts as a successor to adorn it follows his guilty pleasure of morning after sex and the transformation of a purely sexual relationship into one of greater intimacy although it faltered commercially the album was highly praised by critics and fans alike however had everything gone according to plan waves would have likely topped the charts and miguels praises would be ringing even higher but as contemporary rb continues to stray towards a drug induced sound with repetitive themes of lust and narcotic abuse one of the genre's finest continues to challenge his sound and breathe new life into the genre with what may be his finest work to date  zk           4 beach house  thank your lucky starswhen discussing thank your lucky stars one fact is inescapable its not the album beach house were trying to make  and whilst the search for a contextfree album may be a fools errand if stars were a debut album from an up and coming band it would be celebrated as evidence of a great emerging talent  its true that most of these songs probably wouldnt have worked on depression cherry but theyre still great songs  indeed elegy to the void with its dark lyrics and chilling  may be their best since take care beach house arent a conventional band but they have a very defined sound which these songs push against theres much more going on in the lower registers here than on any beach house album since devotion at least the lyrics too are much more grounded while legrand usually speaks directly to the listener about grand themes stars makes much more use of the third person mysterious women lead you to pools of water lovers bend at the altar schoolgirls pray by fading lace curtains  its all quite reminiscent of ishmael butler this is as close to traditional storytelling as beach house has ever come were dropped into real lives and given snippets of information that are just enough to construct a portrait of who they really are  there is an obvious temptation to dismiss this as an afterthought to a masterpiece but its much more than that its almost like the eccentric second disk of one of the great double albums of the seventies its not depression cherry but it more than stands alone  vesuvius            natalie prass  natalie prassin an era of surprise releases and casual diy mixtapes its hard to imagine a label taking two years to release a great record but thats exactly what spacebomb records did with natalie prass  trey pollards string arrangements accentuate prasss delicate delivery whilst the horns in the   of bird of prey bare matthew e whites fingerprints breakup records are a dime a dozen but these breathtaking arrangements are all too rare in contemporary pop pollard and white deserve a great deal of credit for the albums overwhelmingly positive reception  but prasss songwriting is what lifts this record above whites big inner her songs are much more accessible and charming than those of her label mate her use of metaphor is constantly delightful  breakup as predation as a fantasy novel as a train pulling away from a platform  and some of her imagery is visceral she may knock her singing voice but prass provides plenty of intriguing inflections and her vocals simultaneously convey her heartbreak and confidence the crescendo of my baby dont understand me is so affecting because of the synergy between arrangement performance and the train station goodbye metaphor  nobody wants a needless two year delay before they can hear a record  but if it allows prass and spacebomb to keep making records like this its completely worthwhile  vesuvius            lupe fiasco  tetsuo  youthlupe struck that elusive balance between beautiful s intelligent lyrics and vivid storytelling with tetsuo  youth fans and critics alike have praised the album  its even been referred to as a rap genius wet dream yet ty is so much more than just complex annotationworthy lyricism though theres plenty of that too lupe organised the album into three distinct sections separated by sonic palate cleansers named after the four seasons songs are feelgood and upbeat from summer to fall more melancholy leading into winter and then quite ominous though by spring things start to look up again  while every track is brilliantly executed of particular note are the three monsters each exceeding 8 minutes in length summer's mural is an allbarsnohook lyrical assault that will leave you physically tired in a good way by the end fall's prisoner    is the most musically complex track on the album with lyrics drawing a parallel between prison inmates and guards and a striking foundation of string and piano arrangements winters chopper is a ratchet bassheavy beast featuring 6 artists that most wouldnt think team up with lu  few contest that lupe fiasco is a lyrical and creative genius and his ability arguably shines brighter on ty than on any of his previous albums its seasonal transitions mean you can start listening to any track come around full circle and experience the album in a completely different way and just when you think you've digested everything ty has to offer take our word for it and listen once more  backwards  treflip            courtney barnett  sometimes i sit and think and sometimes i just sitcourtney barnetts debut album is quirky and awkward much in the vein of getting the title of it taking it from a poster that hung in her grandmother's bedroom abrasive  riffs simultaneously flow and jag behind barnett who singtalks about well everything her breakout single avant gardener puns off of avant garde you can guess where that goes topics include trying to impress someone while swimming and accidentally fainting a rambling rant about anything to get someone off her mind and a homebuyer's depressing first time looking into the market however it also explores concepts like her newfound fame and selfworth  what really makes the album great is its lack of inhibition  sometimes i sit and think and sometimes i just sit is poignant but not forced her lyrics paint of picture of seemingly anything it's an album you can sit and think toor at least just sit even if she doesn't know who she is she surely sounds good trying to find out  babu sea           0 tame impala  currentscurrents is a stunning nearperfect sonic achievement made all the more powerful by the clash between its precise s and hazy lyrics the lp announces tame impala as the rare group whose work isnt linked by rehashes of the same familiar sounds but consistent mood themes and ethos present at the core of everything they record the bands third offering has been hailed as a departure from their previous work more accurately its an amplification of every shift kevin parker and co made between their debut innerspeaker and followup release lonerism after the magnetism of pop music shook up the groups lofi sound currents pushes the needle even further from psychedelia and towards an rbdisco sound that only threatened to claw to the surface on lonerism instead of hesitantly stripping back a few more s parker all but phased them out for the synths that form the backbone of this lp rather than resist his his growing auteurlike tendencies the groups frontmanwriterproducer parker cut out all collaborations and added another responsibility to his evergrowing list mixing  yet the remarkable thing about currents isnt how indistinguishable the record is from the bands previous releases its how perfectly it blends into the rest of their discography despite marked sonic and lyrical changes it only takes a few notes from the massive  track let it happen to realize this could only be a tame impala album whether this trilogys narrator slides into the past or embraces the healing properties of the future puts on a false bravado or gets crippled by anxiety we are never left feeling that the inconsistencies are the result of parker conjuring up new narrators to deliver oneoff tracks rather were reminded a person is more than their current mindstate just as a band isnt defined by the amount of fuzzy s its employing in any given moment  nick ferguson           9 joanna newsom  diverscall this her my beautiful dark twisted fantasy moment minus the controversy one of musics greatest auteurs collects the stunning aesthetic signifiers of her previous classic works and imagines what theyd sound like all meshed together lacking the featured players from whom kanye derived greatness the lyricism instead is the most important guest star erahopping the loose concept album threaded by time visits a restless pastoral resident leaving the city prerevolutionary america sapokanikan and a futuristic militia on the outskirts of the fourth world war waltz of the 0st airborne to name but a few maneuvering unconventional rhyme schemes is nothing new to her and doctorallevel literary devices are played with the precision usually reserved for her harp but like mbdtf before it divers is an extraordinarily listenable album a populist masterpiece offered up by the only genius capable of creating it  brian duricy           8 susanne sundfør  ten love songswhen susanne sundfør released her third album the brothel norwegian newspaper dagbladet said it would reduce her domestic rivals to tears it was beautiful but it would also make the chasm in talent that stood between them absolutely clear no upcoming artist and precious few established ones could hope to compete with her the brothel set a high bar but ten love songs is a clear step up again sundfør set out to write an album of songs centred on violence but found each of them morphing into a song about love the result is a startling album full of conflict between narratives as well as characters our narrators are unreliable often unsympathetic and highly flawed which makes them all the more compelling on delirious sundfør threatens to push her victim over the edge because she believes him to be the one holding the gun meanwhile silencer is set in the aftermath of a jealous murder sundfør compares the swimming pool in which she disposes of the corpse as an aquarelle of coral blue and red like the colours of your lover's pretty eyes and hair  sundførs vocal performances bring life to her lyrics her range is staggering spanning octaves and emotions almost casually even within songs she convinces with everything from a breathy whisper to the unhinged power of freddie mercury in queens early progmetal stage although the album has an electronic backbone the instrumentation is varied with classical instruments blending incredibly seamlessly with ultramodern dubstep the transitions between songs are similarly masterful pulling the listener deeper into the album the brothel  showed that sundfør was leagues above other norwegian artists ten love songs goes one better and establishes her in the upper echelon of pop musicians internationally as a singer songwriter and visionary few can match her  vesuvius          7 father john misty  i love you honeybearfor two albums the sarcastic witty josh tillman has marauded both on wax and off as the pseudoclerical persona father john misty 0s fear fun and its oftreferenced hallucinogen birth marked a new creative outlet for a st century cynic no longer bound by the serious shackles of a name he never cared for or the dull j tillman his previous eight albums debuted under our father uses the new name as a mask that counterintuitively allows an album truer than before this mask questions the amount of oil it takes to make a record trolls the music press with singular postirony parodies whiskey commercials and social media and hip shakes with postpostured confidence that predates hotline bling during eccentric live performances  consumerism irony and technological dependence return in his latest release i love you honeybearthrough the bourgeoisiebashing bored in the usa and true affection touching on the isolation and dissonance of digital communication but at ilyhbs core sits tillmans immutable motif  a struggle with identity falling in love only heightened the existential battle creating what seems like a fourth iteration of the man now married emma tillman is his honeybear not something he actually calls her offrecord the pet name is a respite from the love songs that the misanthropic narrator so unexpectedly finds himself creating in the middle tracks loathsome ways duced in fear fun return yet despite himself he finds beauty through brutal honesty  he conceals nothing from emma nor the captive audience the ideal husband rattles off ineptitude upon ineptitude finishing with the acceptmeasiam lets put a baby in the oven  wouldnt i make the ideal husband on holy shit the magnitude of his wedding day sinks in as he simultaneously commits to the marriage while pointing out its institutional absurdity bookending the strange loop i went to the store one day is the truest love song here recalling the words and place that spawned the relationship but not without the selfaware lyrical outline insert here a sentiment re our golden years raw and unfiltered for better or for worse right  brock chenier           6 grimes  art angelsthe disconnect between artist and consumer is rarely more apparent than when clear works of excellence are disregarded by their creator when grimes revealed her apprehensions about early single realitis quality critics and fans collectively reacted in disbelief how could one of the years best songs be a mere throwaway and then we heard art angels an album with alienation as a core inspiration containing some of the most zeitgeisty pop of the decade grimes told nme of california i wanted to make a song that is so uncool that no cool hipster people would like it and yet what could capture post808s culture better than you only like me when you think im looking sad a lucky few have the artists mind that could relate to her litmus test of song quality but for the rest of us all we know is that its unbelievably good  brian duricy           5 d'angelo  black messiahlet your days slip away come with me and ride  dangelo aint that easy black messiah is a gem that was 4 years in the making when someone as talented and popular as dangelo just leaves the music scene at the height of his run and has all the well documented troubles hes had there are certainly a few questions  going into his latest mysterious release could he rekindle that same magic from voodoo and brown sugar how would dangelo fit into todays musical landscape what we  got is a triumphant return and an album that lined up perfectly with todays times the socially cognizant nature of the album weighs on the racial tension going on in the united states the michael brown situation actually inspired dangelo to move up the release date of the album from samples of black panther party member fred hampton nation of islamnew black panther party member khalid abdul muhammad to the cover for the album that was shot at an afropunk concert this album is deeply entrenched in black culture the charade in particular captured the thoughts of africanamericans nationwide superbly  the soul and emotion in dangelos voice and personal lyrics resonated as deeply as ever in this musical endeavor dangelo once again showed his mastery as an artist from his  performance which included eclectic but consistently stellar  work to production tremendous vocal harmonies and lyrics dangelo knocks it out of the park in every aspect the cast he assembled included the likes of questlove qtip and kendra foster on this record dangelo showed that he still has that magic of years past and may in fact be sharper than ever  a magnificent return album and certainly worth the 4 year wait  yahwehmon           4 jamie xx  in colourthe highs of jamie xxs  debut in colour are euphoric the atmospheric spection of loud places to the unapologetically bright summer jam  i know theres gonna be good times is the best backtoback punch of the year gosh is an intimidating duction announcing its arrival with harsh jungle mc callouts before sneaking in a deceptively gorgeous drone throw in two more collaborations from his xx bandmates romy and oliver sim and you have a topheavy album that while impressive may initially threaten to topple the record as a whole but under a microscope the less memorable songs flourish in their own right even just saying the 84second prelude to stranger in a room finds strength as a celestial version of a track from groupers ruins whose keys keep their individual power in their differentiation forcing intimacy through the sustained focus of each note this divisive populist electro may never shake its myriad detractors who cry foul about the glossy repackaging of the scene its largely indebted to but its wrong to dismiss such meticulously crafted production because of its accessibility the monolithic in colour will remain a striking affirmation of jamies  chops long after jamie xx lays down his synths  brock chenier             beach house  depression cherrytheres a place i want to take you says victoria legrand on levitation the opening track from depression cherry she and alex scally certainly achieve that here their fifth studio album isnt as cacophonous as bloom and it doesnt dazzle like the peaks of teen dream but its their most immersive and dreamlike album one cant help but feel that it should switch names with the much more downbeat teen dream  it may be dreamlike but its not floaty or airy this is one of those dreams that seem more real than real life where colors are bolder every detail etches itself onto your memory and you find yourself stumbling onto profound truths about mortality maturity love and loss every few minutes the intensity is a steady 80 throughout largely thanks to legrands woozing synths and scallys  flourishes scally most shines on the albums opening tracks on space song his abrasive  sounds like it is popping the bubbles blown by the staccato synth arpeggios a shimmering riff drives the  of sparks before legrands heavy organ fades in and overwhelms him the  is back in the second half of the song whining in the background during several musical transitions  thats where the magic of beach house can be found they largely eschew traditional song structures where most think in beats per minute scally and legrand like joanna newsom work in songs per minute instruments loop hypnotically dropping in and out unpredictably there are faster transitions but even these are smooth and give the impression that the album arrived fullyformed and immaculate so do legrands lyrics that say you will grow old too quick then you will get over it and speak of a unithat goes riding off with you too soon sure enough even this blissful record must come to an end  vesuvius            sufjan stevens  carrie  lowellsufjan stevens has never done the same thing twice a single glance through his discography reveals as eclectic a collection as one could ever hope forhandbells and pure synth classical woodwinds and autotuned lamentations what unites his albums is exactly thisa willingness to play and experiment  but this is not those albums carrie and lowell is the sound of sufjan stevens distilled and perfected hes selected the best parts of his most successful styles and fused them into a perfect synthesisbleak unabashedly personal and almost but not quite on the edge of lowfi  those qualities alone are enough to make any album shine but dont be misleadjust because theres not the same sense of musical playfulness here doesnt mean sufjan isnt breaking any new ground rather than a new musical style carrie  lowells true genius lies in its lyrics carrie  lowell sees sufjan on a poetic form unmatched by any of his previous projects the minimalist wonder of sister or futile devices the dramatic flourishes of palisadesall of these and more are reflected in his new album in every song whether its the unalloyed joy he sees in his niece my brother had a daughterthe beauty that she brings illumination or his selfdestructive behavior in the wake of his mothers death should i tear my eyes out now everything i see returns to you somehow sufjan infuses each line with the same understated beauty and wonder ultimately carrie  lowell is a much more consistently poetic effort than any of his previous projects and a much more ambitious one carrie  lowell brings to the table a maturity sensitivity and depth that sufjan has only ever shown us glimpses of beforeall while maintaining the absolutely noteperfect production and orchestration that is sufjans fortethe only reason why i continue at all faith in reason i wasted my life playing dumb signs and wonders sea lion caves in the dark blind faith gods grace nothing else left to impart nightpool            kendrick lamar  to pimp a butterflykendrick lamars near 80minute epic is a rollercoaster of emotion backed by an eclectic
