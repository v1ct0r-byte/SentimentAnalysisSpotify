# About the proyect
This repo contains a data science project that shows a dynamic dashboard about Spotify playlits and its songs for a given user. We first make use of APIs to collect and extarct data(such as lyrics). With such information we do a sentyment analysis on the lyrics and prepare a dataset. Finally we clean and prepare the dataset that is used to fill the dashboard on a python web application. 

Most of the written code is in python version 3.9.6. We also use some libraries and APIs such as Genius (in obtaining the lyrics) and Spotify (to obtain **public** playlists and songs of a specified user name).

## Used packages, libreries and APIs ##

1. Pandas 
2. Plotly
