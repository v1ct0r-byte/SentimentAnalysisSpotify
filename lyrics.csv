U2,With or Without You,with or without you lyrics see the stone set in your eyes see the thorn twist in your side i'll wait for you sleight of hand and twist of fate on a bed of nails she makes me wait and i wait without you   with or without you with or without you   through the storm we reach the shore you give it all but i want more and i'm waiting for you   with or without you with or without you ahah i can't live with or without you   and you give yourself away and you give yourself away and you give and you give and you give yourself away  my hands are tied my body bruised she got me with nothing to win and nothing left to lose   and you give yourself away and you give yourself away and you give and you give and you give yourself away   with or without you with or without you ohh i can't live with or without you   with or without you with or without you ohh i can't live with or without you with or without you48embed
